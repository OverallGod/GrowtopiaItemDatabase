# Parsing example in C#

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public class MyDataParser 
{
    public static Dictionary<int, ItemData > ItemList = new Dictionary<int, ItemData>();
    
    public static void Main(string[] args) 
    {
	ParseItemNames();
	Console.WriteLine(ItemList[0].ItemName); // Should print "Blank"
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
	
    public static void ParseItemNames() 
    {
	foreach (var j in File.ReadAllLines("CoreData.txt")))
	{
	    if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(j) || j.StartsWith("//")) continue;

	    string[] str = j.Split('|');
	    int id = Convert.ToInt32(str[0]);
	    string itemName = str[1];
	    var item = new ItemData();
	    item.ItemName = str[1];
	    ItemDesc[id] = item;
	}
    }
}

public class ItemData 
{
    public string ItemName { get; set; }
}  
```
